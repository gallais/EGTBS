\begin{abstract}
  I'll write this later when I know what I'm saying.
\end{abstract}

CodeBruijn (``co de Bruijn'') programming is a methodology for
representing and manipulating syntax in a nameless way, like de Bruijn
representation~\cite{deBruijn:dummies}, but making the opposite
canonical choice for exposing the \emph{non}-use of variables.
The essence of the idea is to restrict the \emph{scope} (which variables
\emph{may} occur free) of a term to its \emph{support} (which variables
\emph{do} occur free). Variables are expelled from scope at the roots of
maximal subtrees in which they are not used, where de Bruijn representation
keeps variables in scope from their binding sites all the way to the leaves,
i.e., the minimal subtrees in which they are not used. The codeBruijn
approach thus relies on the maintenance of subtle invariants, reminiscent
of Kennaway and Sleep's `director strings' representation~\cite{DBLP:journals/ipl/KennawayS87}. Dependently typed programming languages such as Agda~\cite{DBLP:conf/afp/Norell08} readily taken on the task of minding that business for us. This paper shows how, and hopefully, why.

The key structure at work is the semi-simplicial category on scopes,
i.e., the category of order-preserving embeddings (colloquially,
`thinnings') from one scope to another. From Bellegarde and
Hook~\cite{bellegarde.hook:substitution.monad}, via Bird and
Paterson~\cite{bird.paterson:debruijn.nested}, and Altenkirch and
Reus~\cite{altenkirch.reus:monads.lambda}, it has become a commonplace
to index types of terms by their scopes. Such types should really be
thought of as `thinnables' --- \emph{functors} from the thinnings ---
because thinnings act compositionally on terms. The operation of
mapping a scope to its identity thinning induces a forgetful functor
from thinnables to scope-indexed types. This forgetful functor has a
celebrated right adjoint, amounting to abstraction over all scopes
into which one's own embeds, which is the basis of Altenkirch, Hofmann
and Streicher's Kripke-model construction which drives normalization
by evaluation ~\cite{DBLP:conf/ctcs/AltenkirchHS95}. But, being a
forgetful functor, one should ask after its \emph{left} adjoint.
That exists, of course, and is the basis of codeBruijn programming: we
define \emph{relevant} terms, indexed by \emph{support}, then make them
\emph{freely} thinnable by attaching the thinning from support to scope
at the root of the term. Further thinnings act by composition at the root,
without traversing the term at all.

This paper is written as a literate Agda implementation of a
codeBruijn toolkit, structured categorically. I formalise the active
categorical abstractions, given provocation from the task at hand. I have
adopted something of a tutorial style, partly because there is some novelty
in teaching category theory to functional programmers with examples which are
not sets-and-functions, but mostly because I am teaching myself. I hope it
is also a useful engagement with dependently typed programming, for category
theorists. I shall certainly draw the \emph{diagrams} which drive the
constructions. There will also be some transferable lessons about programming
`craft' which I shall seek to draw out.


\section{de Bruijn Representation}

In 1999, Altenkirch and Reus gave a de Bruijn treatment of simply
typed $\lambda$-calculus, together with an implementation of simultaneous
substitution~\cite{altenkirch.reus:monads.lambda}. Let us review how it goes.

The simple types are given inductively.

%format Set = "\D{Set}"
%format -> = "\mathrel{\D{\to}}"
%format Type = "\D{Ty}"
%format base = "\C{base}"
%format ->>  = "\mathrel{\C{\supset}}"
%format _->>_ = "\C{" _ "\!}" ->> "\C{\!" _ "}"
\begin{code}
infixr 30 _->>_

data Type : Set where
  base   : Type
  _->>_  : Type -> Type -> Type
\end{code}

In Agda, infix operators are named with |_| in their argument places.
Types are arranged in backwards (`\emph{snoc}-') lists to
form \emph{contexts}.

%format Bwd = "\D{Bwd}"
%format [] = "\C{[]}"
%format -, = "\mathbin{\C{\mathrm{-\hspace*{-0.03in},}}}"
%format _-,_ = "\C{" _ "\!}" -, "\C{\!" _ "}"
%format Context = "\D{Cx}"
\begin{code}
infixl 20 _-,_

data Bwd (X : Set) : Set where
  []    : Bwd X
  _-,_  : Bwd X -> X -> Bwd X

Context = Bwd Type
\end{code}

\begin{craft}[Backwards Lists]
Forwards lists are much more commonplace in functional programming,
but I have learned the hard way to use a separate type for lists
which grow on the right. The cognitive cost of interpreting lists
in reverse is higher, at times, than I can pay: I make mistakes.
I also choose symbols for `snoc' and `cons' which avoid misleading
reflectional symmetry and have modest pictographic value.
\end{craft}

Typed de Bruijn indices select \emph{one} entry from a context.
%format <<- = "\mathrel{\D{\shortleftarrow}}"
%format _<<-_ = "\D{" _ "\!}" <<- "\D{\!" _ "}"
%format _<<- = "\D{" _ "\!}" <<-
%format ze = "\C{ze}"
%format su = "\C{su}"
%format Ga = "\V{\Gamma}"
%format De = "\V{\Delta}"
%format sg = "\V{\sigma}"
%format ta = "\V{\tau}"
%format !!- = "\mathrel{\D{\vdash}}"
%format _!!-_ = "\D{" _ "\!}" !!- "\D{\!" _ "}"
%format !!-_ = !!- "\D{\!" _ "}"
%format va = "\C{va}"
%format ap = "\C{ap}"
%format la = "\C{la}"
\begin{code}
infix 10 _<<-_

data _<<-_ (ta : Type) : Context -> Set where
  ze  : {-<-} forall {Ga} -> {->-}     ta <<- Ga -, ta
  su  : {-<-} forall {Ga sg} -> {->-}  ta <<- Ga
      ->                               ta <<- Ga -, sg
\end{code}

\begin{craft}[Parameters, Uniform Indices, Restrictable Indices]
In the |data| declaration of an Agda type former, some things are
declared left of |:| and scope over the whole declaration. They
must be used \emph{uniformly} in the \emph{return} types of value
constructors. They are, however, free to vary in the types of
recursive substructures. If they do so vary, we call them \emph{uniform}
indices. Only if they remain constant throughout should we refer to
them as \emph{parameters}. So, |ta|, above is a parameter, but |Ga|, below
is a uniform index. The distinction impacts the category in which an
initial object is being constructed. |(ta <-_)| is constructed in
|Context -> Set|, while |_!!-_| is constructed in
|Context -> Type -> Set|. Meanwhile, right of |:| come those things
which may be restricted to particular patterns of value in the return
types of value constructors, e.g., \emph{nonempty} contexts above,
and \emph{function} types below.
\end{craft}

The type of terms reflect the typing rules, indexed by a context and
the type being inhabited.

\begin{code}
infix 10 _!!-_

data _!!-_ (Ga : Context) : Type -> Set where

  va  : {-<-} forall {ta} -> {->-}     ta <<- Ga
      ->                               Ga !!- ta

  ap  : {-<-} forall {sg ta} -> {->-}  Ga !!- sg ->> ta
      ->                               Ga !!- sg
      ->                               Ga !!- ta

  la  : {-<-} forall {sg ta} -> {->-}  Ga -, sg !!- ta
      ->                               Ga !!- sg ->> ta
\end{code}

Observe that the context we are handed at the root of a term only ever gets
larger, each time we use a |la|mbda. Only when we reach a |va|riable to we
choose one thing from the context and discard the rest.

Now, a \emph{simultaneous substitution} is a type-respecting mapping from
variables in some source context |Ga| to terms over target context |De| ---
from |(_<<- Ga)| to |(De !!-_)|, if you will. When we push such a thing
under |la|, we need instead a mapping from
|(_<<- Ga -, sg)| to |(De -, sg !!-_)|. We can map the newly bound |ze| to
|va ze|, but the trouble is that all of |Ga|'s variables are mapped to terms
over |De|, not |De -, sg|. It is thus necessary to traverse all those terms
and adjust their leaves, because it is only at the leaves that we document
\emph{non}-usage of variables. Shift happens.

Worse, if we attempt to carry out the shift by simultaneous
substitution, we leave the comfortable territory of structural
recursion and have some explaining to do. It is useful to observe that
shifts are merely simultaneous (order-preserving, injective) renumberings
which may readily act on terms. Once we have simultaneous renumbering
available, simultaneous substitution is easy. Moreover, they are very
similar, so we may readily abstract the common structure, as I learned
from Goguen and McKinna and demonstrated in my
thesis~\cite{goguenmckinna,DBLP:phd/ethos/McBride00}.

Shifts --- simultaneous renumberings --- are the problem, but they are also
the key to the solution.


\section{Thinnings}

\begin{definition}[Thinnings]
We may define the thinnings, i.e., the order-preserving embeddings,
our simultaneous renumberings, as follows:

%format <= = "\mathrel{\D{\le}}"
%format _<=_ = "\D{" _ "\!}" <= "\D{\!" _ "}"
%format -^ = "\mathbin{\C{\mathrm{-\hspace*{-0.06in}\raisebox{-0.04in}{\^{}}}}}"
%format _-^_ = "\C{" _ "\!}" -^ "\C{\!" _ "}"
%format ga = "\V{\gamma}"
%format de = "\V{\delta}"
%format ze = "\V{\zeta}"
\begin{code}
module _ {X : Set} where  -- fix a set |X| of \emph{sorts}, e.g., |Type|

  infix 10 _<=_
  infixl 20 _-^_

  data _<=_ : Bwd X ->                       Bwd X -> Set where

    _-^_  :   {-<-} forall {ga de} -> {->-}  ga       <= de
          ->  forall x ->                    ga       <= de -, x

    _-,_  :   {-<-} forall {ga de} -> {->-}  ga       <= de
          ->  forall x ->                    ga -, x  <= de -, x

    []    :                                  []       <= []
\end{code}
\end{definition}

I am careful to speak of our backward lists as \emph{scopes}, rather than
\emph{contexts}, as it is not necessary for them to document the \emph{types}
of the variables for this machinery to work.

We lift the constructors from lists to represent the situation
where parts of the source scope are copied to the target, but we also
introduce |-^| to insert an extra element in the target.

Electronic engineers will notice that a thinning is more or less a vector
of bits, with |-^| for 0 and |-,| for 1, but it is indexed by its
\emph{population} --- the entries marked 1. Expect Boolean operations.

%format io = "\F{\upiota}"
\begin{definition}[identity thinnings, |io|]
Let us observe that identity thinnings exist, copying their scope.

\begin{code}
  io : forall {ga} -> ga <= ga
  io {[]}       = []
  io {ga -, x}  = io {ga} -, x
\end{code}
\end{definition}

\begin{craft}[Implicits]
Agda uses curly braces to mark arguments which are normally suppressed.
In general, it is sensible to adopt the suppression convention
appropriate for the expected \emph{use} sites. Here, the fact that |<=| is a type constructor means
that |ga| will be determined if the type is given in advance.
Often, we then have to use an explicit override at definition sites. 
This sort of thing never happens in Hindley-Milner
languages because any information for which inference is permitted is
guaranteed to be operationally useless. The inference of operationally
useful information represents progress.
\end{craft}

Further, thinnings compose. I write composition diagrammatically.

%format -fake = "\mathbin{\F{\fatsemi}}"
%format _-fake_ = "\F{" _ "\!}" -fake "\F{\!" _ "}"

\begin{definition}[thinning composition, |-fake|]
Thinnings fore and aft compose thus:

%format th = "\V{\theta}"
%format ph = "\V{\phi}"
%format ps = "\V{\psi}"
\begin{code}
  infixl 20 _-fake_

  _-fake_ : {-<-} forall {ga de ze} -> {->-} ga <= de -> de <= ze -> ga <= ze
  th         -fake (ph -^ x)  = th -fake ph -^ x
  (th -^ x)  -fake (ph -, x)  = th -fake ph -^ x
  (th -, x)  -fake (ph -, x)  = th -fake ph -, x
  []         -fake []         = []
\end{code}
\end{definition}

\begin{craft}[Operator Priority and Association]
My habit is to arrange priority and association
so that computation results in net decrease of parentheses.
\end{craft}

\begin{craft}[Laziness and Definitional Equality]
Working in intensional type theories like Agda involves a certain
amount of care with the equational properties of programs --- the typechecker
will run these programs, as defined, on open terms.
So the order of the lines in the above program matters. If the aft-thinning
inserts, there is no call to inspect the fore-thinning. Only if the aft
thinning copies need we ask what the fore-thinning gives us. If the first
line is moved later, the function becomes unnecessarily strict in the
fore-thinning, and definitional equality loses power.
\end{craft}

The reader should note that I will shortly substitute a subtly different
definition of composition for this one. Rest assured that its replacement
will satisfy the above equations.


\section{When `Green Slime' is Bad, Avoid It}

We are accustomed to reasoning by \emph{equation}.

%format ~ = "\mathrel{\D{\sim}}"
%format _~_ = "\D{" _ "\!}" ~ "\D{\!" _ "}"
%format r~ = "\C{r\!\!\sim}"

\begin{definition}[Inductive Equality, |~|]
In Agda, we may give an inductive definition of equality,
as follows:
\begin{code}
infix 5 _~_
data _~_ {l}{X : Set l}(x : X) : X -> Set where
  r~ : x ~ x
\end{code}
The |l| parameter is an arbitrary \emph{level} in the
Russell-style hierarchy: |Set| abbreviates |Set 0|;
|Set 0 : Set 1|, and so on.
%if False
\begin{code}
{-# BUILTIN EQUALITY _~_ #-}
\end{code}
%endif
\end{definition}

The above definition is \emph{intensional}, in that we
can give canonical evidence that |x ~ y| only if |x| and
|y| have the same \emph{implementation}, up to definitional
equality. We shall have trouble because of that, in what is
to follow, but that is not the trouble I mean to discuss in
this section.

Suppose we have an hypothesis |q : th -fake ph ~ ps -, x|.
We ought to be able to deduce that |th| and |ph| are both
made by |(_-, x)|. However, pattern matching on the equality
proof |q| will fail, because it is not clear how to unify
|th -fake ph| with |ps -, x|, unless we are gifted with the
power to run functions backwards, which Agda is not. Our
only option is to \emph{remember} how |-fake| computes, then
match on |ph| and |th|, eliminating the impossible cases
which arise by refuting |q|.

`Green slime' is a colloquialism for expressions involving
recursively defined functions which do not compute to
canonical form. It is toxic to unification, as it unifies
only with variables (purple things). Fortunately, there
are strategies to avoid it.

%format grf = "\F{f}"
%format blF = "\D{F}"
%format bks = "s"
%format bkt = "t"
\begin{craft}[Inductive Relations are Invertible]
It is often useful to replace equations |grf bks ~ bkt|
with relations |blF bks bkt|, where |blF| is defined
inductively to be the \emph{graph} of |f|.
\end{craft}

Let us put this into practice at once!

\begin{definition}[composition triangle]
Reading from the definition of |-fake|, construct its
graph, thus:
%format CTL = "\D{\ulcorner}\,"
%format CTM = "\,\D{\fatsemi}\,"
%format CTR = "\,\D{\urcorner\!\!\sim}\,"
%format (CTri (th) (ph) (ps)) = CTL th CTM ph CTR ps
%format (CTS1 (ph) (ps)) = (CTL _ CTM ph CTR ps)
%format (CTS2 (th) (ps)) = (CTL th CTM _ CTR ps)
%format (CTS3 (th) (ph)) = (CTL th CTM ph CTR _)
%format -^, = "\mathbin{\C{\mathrm{-\hspace*{-0.06in}\raisebox{-0.04in}{\^{}}\hspace*{-0.03in},}}}"
%format _-^,_ = "\C{" _ "\!}" -^, "\C{\!" _ "}"

%if False
\begin{code}
module _ {X : Set} where
\end{code}

CTS3 = CTri
\end{code}
%endif
\begin{spec}

\end{spec}
\end{definition}

And there was nothing green to be seen! The only green things on the right in the
definition of |-fake| were recursive calls to |-fake|, and these we have replaced
by variables.

I call inhabitants of |(CTri th ph ps)|
\emph{composition triangles} exactly because they witness the commutation of the
diagram
\[\xymatrix{
                        & |ze| \\
  |de| \ar[ru]^{|ph|}   &      \\
                        & |ga| \ar[lu]^{|th|}\ar[uu]_{|ps|}\\
}\]
Now let us get our hands on them. You might think that the thing to do is to prove
\[
|(th : ga <= de)(ph : de <= ze) -> (CTri th ph (th -fake ph))|
\]
but that amounts to implementing composition a \emph{third} time, as well as being
pragmatically suboptimal, as I shall explain later. A better move is to reimplement
|-fake| by proving, morally,
\[
|(th : ga <= de)(ph : de <= ze) ->| \;\mbox{`$\exists |ps|.$'}\; |(CTri th ph ps)|
\]
We shall have need of existential quantification!

%format Sg = "\D{\Upsigma}"
\begin{definition}[Dependent Pair Types]
Dependent pair types (|Sg|-types, in the jargon) may be introduced as
\emph{records}, where the
type of the second projection depends on the value of the first. The definition
is polymorphic in the type theoretic hierarchy.
%format Sg = "\D{\Upsigma}"
%format [* = "(\!"
%format :: = ":"
%format ]* = "\!)\mathrel{\D{\times}}"
%format , = "\C{,}"
%format _,_ = "\C{" _ "}" , "\C{" _ "}"
%format fst = "\F{fst}"
%format snd = "\F{snd}"
\begin{code}
infixr 5 _,_

record Sg {k l}(S : Set k)(T : S -> Set l) : Set (l \-/ k) where
  constructor _,_
  field
    fst  : S
    snd  : T fst
open Sg public     -- brings the projections into scope

syntax Sg S (\ x -> T) = [* x :: S ]* T
\end{code}
It is convenient to sugar dependent pair types as a binding form,
after the fashion of dependent
function types\footnote{Agda does not let you do precisely this, but \LaTeX{} does
the rest.}.
\end{definition}

Two commonly occurring degenerate forms merit abbreviation.

The first of these is ordinary non-dependent pairing. The second, prounounced
`possibly |T|', asserts that a `predicate' (i.e., a function to |Set l|) is
somehow satisfied: the domain of the predicate is elided.

\begin{craft}[Mixfix Operator Sections]
The relation |CTL _ CTM _ CTR _| is given in mixfix form exactly because Agda
supports operator sections --- |(CTS1 ph ps)|, |(CTS2 th ps)| and |(CTS3 th ph)|
--- which are predicates designed to be used with |<_>|.
\end{craft}

\begin{lemma}[constructing composition triangles, |<->|]
If |th| and |ph| are thinnings which meet in the middle, it is possible to
construct their composition triangle. Accordingly,
we may redefine |-fake| to project the existential witness.
\begin{code}
infix 10 _<->_

_<->_ : {-<-} forall {X}{ga de ze : Bwd X} -> {->-} (th : ga <= de)(ph : de <= ze) -> <(CTS3 th ph)>
th       <-> ph -^ x  with _ , v <- th <-> ph  = _ , v -^ x
th -^ x  <-> ph -, x  with _ , v <- th <-> ph  = _ , v -^, x
th -, x  <-> ph -, x  with _ , v <- th <-> ph  = _ , v -, x
[]       <-> []                                = _ , []

_-<=_ : {-<-} forall {X}{ga de ze : Bwd X} -> {->-} ga <= de -> de <= ze -> ga <= ze
th -<= ph = fst (th <-> ph)
\end{code}
\end{lemma}

\begin{craft}[|with| Programs]
The |with| programming notation~\cite{DBLP:journals/jfp/McBrideM04}
%format vep = "\vec{p}"
%format vep1 = vep "_1"
%format vepn = vep "_n"
%format blp = "p"
%format blp1 = blp "_1"
%format blpn = blp "_n"
%format ble = "e"
%format ble1 = ble "_1"
%format blen = ble "_n"
%format vdots = "\vdots"
\begin{spec}
grf vep   with   ble
grf vep1  |      blp1  = ble1
          vdots
grf vepn  |      blpn  = blen
\end{spec}
allows us to extend the left-hand side of a program with an extra column for
the value of |ble|, so we may match patterns anywhere, refining the original
patterns |vep| as well as asking about |ble|. Usefully, |ble| is abstracted
from any types where it occurs, so matching on its value refines types, too.

By defining |-<=| as a projection of |<->|, we make |with th <-> ph| abstract
all occurrences of |-<=| at the same time as it yields up the composition
triangle. The same is true of any program defined as the existential witness
to the possibility of satisfying a specification.

The recently added notation, |with blp <- ble|, allows us to avoid introducing
a new line to the pattern match if there is only \emph{one} case, given by
|blp|.
\end{craft}

\begin{craft}[Invisible Programs]
Agda allows the `don't care' |_| to be used both in patterns, where it neglects to
ask a question, and in expressions, where it neglects to give an answer. In the
latter case, the missing term must be inferable by unification. In the case of
function graphs, the program already given in the relation determines by its
construction the missing existential witnesses. The composition \emph{function}
has all but disappeared!
\end{craft}

Now, composition triangles give the graph of a function, and functions are
deterministic, accordingly, we should be able to recover the fact that the
inputs determine both the output and the witness.

\begin{lemma}[Uniqueness of Composition Triangles]
For any given inputs |th| and |ph|, there is at most one |ps| and at most one
|v| such that |v : (CTri th ph ps)|.

\end{spec}
\end{lemma}

\begin{craft}[Dependent Equations]
The equation |v0 ~ v1| may look ill typed, but it is not. The inlined pattern match
in the dependent pair type causes |ps0| to unify with |ps1|. This can be quite a
convenient way to specify `telescopic' equations.
\end{craft}

\begin{craft}[Contraction Pattern, |contraction|]
In typeset code, I write |contraction| instead of unique patterna which can be
constructed by record expansion followed by one step of case analysis. Matching
with |contraction| collapses spaces to a point. Agda does not yet support this
feature. Here, it abbreviates |r~ , r~|, but it can scale to much larger
uninteresting types.
\end{craft}

We have a notion of thinning, closed under identity and composition. I like to
visualize thinnings as two horizontal sequences of dots. Each dot on the bottom
 is joined to a dot on top by a vertical chord, but there may be dots on top with no
chord incident.
\[\begin{array}{ccccc}
  \bullet & \bullet & \bullet & \bullet & \bullet \vspace*{-0.17in}\\
  \mid && \mid && \mid \vspace*{-0.17in}\\
  \bullet && \bullet && \bullet \\
\end{array}\]
The identity thinning has all chords present. Composition is vertical pasting,
followed by the contraction of chords which do not reach the bottom.
\[|io| \quad = \quad
  \begin{array}{ccccc}
  \bullet & \bullet & \bullet & \bullet & \bullet \vspace*{-0.17in}\\
  \mid & \mid & \mid & \mid & \mid \vspace*{-0.17in}\\
  \bullet & \bullet & \bullet & \bullet & \bullet \\
\end{array}
\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad
\begin{array}{cccccc}
        &\bullet & \bullet & \bullet & \bullet & \bullet \vspace*{-0.17in}\\
        &\mid && \mid && \mid \vspace*{-0.17in}\\
        &\bullet && \bullet && \bullet \vspace*{-0.17in}\\
  |-<=| &\mid &&&& \mid  \vspace*{-0.17in}\\
        &\bullet &&&& \bullet
\end{array}
\quad = \quad
\begin{array}{ccccc}
  \bullet & \bullet & \bullet & \bullet & \bullet \vspace*{-0.17in}\\
  \mid &&  && \mid \vspace*{-0.17in}\\
  \mid &&  && \mid \vspace*{-0.17in}\\
  \mid &&&& \mid  \vspace*{-0.17in}\\
  \bullet &&&& \bullet
\end{array}
\]
Spatial intuition makes it clear, informally, that identitied are absorbed and that
composition is associative. We should thus be able to construct a category. But what
does it mean \emph{in type theory} to construct a category? That is when our troubles
really begin.


\section{Type Theorists Worry About Equality}

An ingenue (or very sophisticated troll) once wrote to some mathematical mailing list
asking whether category theory and type theory were the same. Some category theorists
answered vaguely in the positive, at which point the type theorists accused them of
insufficiently interrogating the meaning of `the same'. The title of this section is
tantamount to a definition of the discipline, especially if you come from the school
which takes the classification of a thing to be the diagonal of the classified
partial equivalence relation which says when two things are the same.

Informally, a category is given by
\begin{enumerate}
\item some notion of \emph{objects};
\item for every pair of objects, \emph{source} and \emph{target},
  some notion of \emph{arrows} from source to target;
\item for each object, an \emph{identity} arrow from that object to itself;
\item for each pair of arrows which meet in the middle, a \emph{composite} arrow from
  the source of the first to the target of the second;
\item ensuring that composition absorbs identity and associates, i.e., that some
  equations between arrows hold.
\end{enumerate}

For thinnings, our objects are scopes and |<=| tells us what the arrows are. We have
candidates for identity and composition. We can take the same view of types and
functions: |Set| gives our objects, |->| our arrows, and we have the identity function
and function composition.

But any type theorist will ask, or rather will \emph{be asked} by their equipment,
`What is the status of equations between arrows?'. For thinnings, which are first
order inductive data structures (indeed, bit vectors), the intensional |~| should
suffice; for functions, |~| is dangerously restrictive, identifying only functions
with the same \emph{implementation}, up to definitional equality. Any workable
notion of category within type theory has to negotiate this distinction, which is
waved away in everyday mathematical practice.

We have three options:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Worry About Equality.}~ Work to replace intensional |~| by something which
  better reflects mathematical intuition. That is the work of many lifetimes,
  mine included, and it is beginning to pay off. Observational Type Theory gave
  a good answer to when values are equal, but not such a good answer to when types are
  equal. (It was never the basis of a usable implementation, a fact for which I
  bear some blame.) Homotopy Type Theory gives a better answer, and in its Cubical
  variant, is beginning to materialise. This is the best option, if you have
  patience.
\item \emph{Tell Lies.}~ Postulate that |~| has the properties we wish it had, e.g.
  that pointwise equal functions are equal. Get on with exploring the important ideas.
  Unfortunately, the computational properties of postulates frustrate the execution of
  actual, if sophisticated, programs when proofs of equations are used to transport
  actual values between merely provably equal types. None the less, this is the best
  option, if you have undergraduates.
\item \emph{Tell Weaker Truths.}~ Arrange to work up to |~| when you
  can (e.g., with thinnings) and to weaker notions (e.g., pointwise equality for
  functions) when you cannot. This is the best option, if you are in a hurry.
\end{enumerate}

My head is with option 1, my heart is with option 2, but my entire digestive system is
with option 3, so that is how I shall proceed in this paper.
